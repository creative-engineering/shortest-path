This repository contains the code developed of the Shortest Path project @ DTU Skylab spring 2018.
The project consists of multi threaded Arduino code for the Wemos D1 mini pro (ESP8266) and a dijkstra based browser application written in JavaScript (node.js). 

The path finding application is a modified version of Senniksoft's great JavaScript implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm. I highly encourage you to take a look yourself - [https://github.com/senniksoft/Dijkstra-s-algorithm-in-Action-With-RealMap](https://github.com/senniksoft/Dijkstra-s-algorithm-in-Action-With-RealMap).

The entire project is under the MIT license so feel free to use or modify as long as credit is given there credit is due.
